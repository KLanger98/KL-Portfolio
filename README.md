# KL-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio has been created to provide information about myself, insight into projects I have created and contributed to along with details and links to contact me. This portfolio is also a demonstration of my CSS and HTML expertise.

When creating this portfolio I really wanted it to reflect who I am and my interests. So first things first I took advantage of all three of the hobbies I have been absorbed by in the last year: photography, hiking and travelling. To do this I built the top of my webpage around a photo I took while hiking through Austria with my girlfriend and friend (who can be seen if you look close enough). I then wanted to make the website personal by adding an image of me and a logo. When viewing this page on larger screens the logo has been designed to resemble a similar dimensions to a fujifilm instax polaroid, another camera I enjoy using around friends. The rest of the webpage I tried to keep as simple as possible with clean organisation and some interesting interactive features.

While making this portfolio I learnt some valuable skills in managing media queries in order to make a responsive website. I spent a long time really trying to understand how my website will appear on my computer versus my phone and adjusted sizes and functionality as appropriate. I also learnt some interesting techniques using the CSS animation, transition and hover features which i incorporated into all my interactive components of the webpage. Most of the time in this project was spent positioning everything which allowed me to gain a strong understanding of flexbox.
