# KL-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio has been created to provide information about myself, insight into projects I have created and contributed to along with details and links to contact me. This portfolio is also a demonstration of my CSS and HTML expertise.

When creating this portfolio I really wanted it to reflect who I am and my interests. So first things first I took advantage of all three of the hobbies I have been absorbed by in the last year: photography, hiking and travelling. To do this I built the top of my webpage around a photo I took while hiking through Austria with my girlfriend and friend (who can be seen if you look close enough). I then wanted to make the website personal by adding an image of me and a logo. When viewing this page on larger screens the logo has been designed to resemble a similar dimensions to a fujifilm instax polaroid, another camera I enjoy using around friends. The rest of the webpage I tried to keep as simple as possible with clean organisation and some interesting interactive features.

While making this portfolio I learnt valuable skills in managing media queries in order to make a responsive website. I spent a long time really trying to understand how my website will appear on wider screens versus smaller screens such as phones and adjusted sizes and functionality as appropriate. I also learnt some interesting techniques using the CSS animation, transition and hover features which I incorporated into all of my interactive components of the webpage. My understanding of flexbox as a concept improved considerable with this project thanks to the varied positioning scenarios used with this website.

The websites responsiveness can also be seen by reducing the screens width using chrome developer tools. The website has been designed to be readable on computer monitors and mobile phones.
